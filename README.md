My journey on AlphaGo experiments. First on 5x5 board:
- [C2 Opening and intracacies](https://hyu2000.github.io/go5/model-evolution.html)
- [5x5 Go complexity](https://hyu2000.github.io/go5/5x5-complexity.html)
- [Dissecting "super-human performance" of AlphaGo](go5/super-human.md)

If 5x5 Go is a puzzle, 9x9 is more like the real deal. And you can finish a game in several minutes instead of hours!
- [Dispatch from the trenches: from 5x5 to 9x9](go5/go5-to-9.md)
- [Training bot to play endgames](https://hyu2000.github.io/go5/endgame.html)
- [Too many bots](go5/model-evaluate.md)
- [Some super-human 9x9 games and my attempt at an analysis](go5/kata-analysis-9x9-1.md)

More to come ...
