<h2>Revisiting 5x5 through the lens of KataGo</h2>

<p>
Below we show the optimal game in 5x5 Go with C2 opening, analyzed by one of the super-human KataGo models.
<input type="button" value="view" onclick="playerB.loadSgfFromFile('sgf/kata-on-go5/optimalC2.analysis-by-b20.v500.sgf', 4);"/>
Chinese rule is used, komi=0. The comments section shows lots of useful information for potential moves: predicted win-rate, score
	difference, number of visits, principle variation, etc. The actual move is marked with an asterisk.

<p>
Most of the time KataGo agrees with the optimal play. Sometimes it evaluates a move accurately, with just
a single visit.

<h2> Puzzle Time</h2>

<p>
On the other hand, it did rank the best move second several times. Sometimes it's due to symmetry, where the
two choices are essentially the same.

<p>
The worst ranking is for move #4, the "cut" move. It thinks B3/C4 is 1.5 points better. Let's take a closer
look. Initially, it did look like white has found a better move than B2. And if black is not careful, the game can end in
a particularly interesting way. I got here by forcing KataGo to play B3 response, but set up the komi incorrectly.
<input type="button" value="view" onclick="playerS.loadSgfFromFile('sgf/kata-on-go5/C2C3D3B3-komi5.5variation.sgf', 5);"/>

<p>
This ending (double ko) is quite interesting. Result of the game varies depending on
the ko rule used. While I think it is fair that each side be awarded one ko (a white win in this case),
KataGo training, for example, considers this game void (a.k.a. <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?EternalLife">eternal life</a>).

<p>
When I ask KataGo to play the B3 response with the correct komi=0, the final score is just 1 point.
<input type="button" value="view" onclick="playerS.loadSgfFromFile('sgf/kata-on-go5/C2C3D3B3.sgf', 5);"/>

<p>Although this is less than the original score estimate at move #4, it is a better outcome for white. Therefore,
it should indeed choose B3 over D2. What's going on? Is the optimal sequence not truly optimal?

<p>
After quite some head-scratching and poking around, I found that B3/C4 can lead to a 3-point win as well.
So the good news is that there are multiple paths leading to 3-point win.
I will leave the exact sequence of play as a take-home exercise :)
<input type="button" value="view" onclick="playerS.loadSgfFromFile('sgf/kata-on-go5/C2C3D3B3.3pt-win.sgf', 5);"/>


<p>
Also, if you are not careful, even with the "cut" play (D2), black could end up winning by 1 point, short of
the expected 3 points.
<input type="button" value="view" onclick="playerS.loadSgfFromFile('sgf/kata-on-go5/C2C3D3D2.1pt-win.sgf', 4);"/>
From the comments section above, we can see that for move #6, white thinks E2 is better than B2.

<p>
I think the underlying reason is that KataGo wasn't really trained on boards as small
as 5x5. While it plays 5x5 quite well, the model is not as sharp as it could've been. More search is needed
to compensate for that. The full analysis (with more searches) will be shown on the big board
<input type="button" value="above" onclick="playerB.loadSgfFromFile('sgf/kata-on-go5/optimalC2.analysis-by-b20.v1000.sgf', 4);"/>.
Now if we go to move #6, we see that B2 is the top choice and E2 has dropped way off.

<p>
On a side note, KataGo plays strongly in any situation, whereas the standard AZ maximizes win-rate only. The actual
score is of no importance to AZ. In other words, we cannot expect well-trained AZ model to pursue the optimal
path. It may pick <em>any</em> winning path.


<h2>Have we finally solved 5x5?</h2>
<p>
While I was researching the puzzle mentioned above, I remembered that in my own 5x5 bot training, the C2-C3-D3-B3
sequence did happen, see the 2nd and 3rd board <a href="https://hyu2000.github.io/go5/model-evolution.html">there</a>.
The game shown there is on a different path, which is considered quite sub-optimal by KataGo models. Here is how
KataGo would proceed.
<input type="button" value="view" onclick="playerS.loadSgfFromFile('sgf/kata-on-go5/C2C3D3B3B2.v1000.sgf', 5);"/>
It has again turned into a big fight and ends in a double-ko situation.

<p>
Are we set on all those C2 variations now? I'm confident, but I'd still take it with a grain of salt.
If you look closely at the win-rate estimates / policy priors, there is still room for improvement.
