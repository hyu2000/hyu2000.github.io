<h2>5x5 Go: easy-peasy?</h2>

  <div id="C2opt" class="floatright"></div>

<p>
The size of a regular Go board is 19 by 19. It's well known that the number of possible board states is
more than that of atoms in the universe. That's why AlphaGo is hailed as a major breakthrough.
But how hard can it be, if we play on a 5x5 board?
</p>

<p>
Let's do some math. 25 positions on the board, each can be either empty, black, or white.
<p>
    3**25=847 billion! Surprisingly large.
<p>
Okay, not all of them are legal.

The more precise number (of legal board configurations) is <a href="https://tromp.github.io/go/legal.html"> 414 billions</a>, 414,295,148,741 to be exact.

<p>
We can reduce that number using symmetries: rotation, flip. This leads to a total of 8 combinations. But with even a 100-fold reduction, it's still four cool billions.
</p>

<h2>Search tree and reasonable openings</h2>
Both AlphaGo (MCTS) and minimax are essentially building a tree to search through that huge space of possibilities.
It starts from opening moves.
<p>
If you play a couple 5x5 Go games, you will quickly appreciate that C3 opening is likely the winner (indeed it is).

Taking into account symmetries, there are really 5 other openings. Since A1/B1/C1 looks odd (to me at least), that leaves us just C2 and B2.

We can push the symmetry argument a bit further, but that complicates implementation. We need to jump through
quite some hoops. And it's simply not clear how to enforce symmetry with neural networks.
<p>
If we restrict ourselves to C3/C2/B2 openings, and some common sense (like not go on 1-line unless necessary),
the search tree might be manageable, since the most interesting part of the game is likely within the first
10 moves. By that time the game has taken a certain shape, and it may <em>seem</em> straightforward to solve for the rest of the game.
<p>
But is it true? The issue of life and death looms large in endgames. Dead-stone removal is in fact far from trivial.
There is only one algorithm to check for pass-alive area, which is used by KataGo and others to speed up end-games.


<h2>C2 opening: best play and variations</h2>
<p>
According to <a href="http://erikvanderwerf.tengen.nl/5x5/5x5solved.html">Werf, et al</a>, the best play for C2 opening is:
  C2 C3 D3 D2 D1 B2 E2 C4. It's shown above. Click the arrow button or use left/right key to step through the game.
Black wins by 3 points.
<p>
I trained my AlphaZero bot on this particular opening. In the process I learned of the complexity of the game
beyond my expectation.

<p class="floatcleared"></p>

<h3>Move #6: E2 variation</h3>
<div id="C2botE2" class="floatright"></div>

<p>
During self-play runs, bot has found this opening instead:
  C2 C3 D3 D2 D1 E2 (white plays E2 to avoid capture, shown on the right)

and strongly likes it. Most of them lead to a black win.

<p>
This doesn't make sense at all. The white stone cannot be saved. What's the bot thinking? Is it just one of the intermediate stages
(read: <em>suboptimal</em>) before it masters the C2 opening?

<p class="floatcleared"></p>

<h3>My first speculation</h3>

<div id="E2myplay1" class="floatright"></div>

<p>
Looking at how black would respond to this E2 move, it's actually not straightforward at all.
<p>
The best response <em>I think</em> is:
  E3(threat) B2(threat) E1(take) C4 D4 D5(disallow eye) B4 B5 B3(threat) C5(save) E5(threat) E4(ko) B1(threat) A2(extend)
  E5(ko).  White lost in a ko fight!
<p>
As an alternative, if white doesn't go aggressive in D5, it can survive (e.g. A4), but with a loss, as expected.

<p class="floatcleared"></p>

<h3>and how they are wrong!</h3>

<div id="E2botplay1" class="floatright"></div>
<p>
When I play (black) on this variation against my bot, white aggression at D5 seems to hold.
It responds with B3 when I attack at B4. And no matter what I try, white wins!
</p>

<p class="floatcleared"></p>

<h3>My second speculation</h3>
<div id="E2myplay2" class="floatright"></div>
<p>
I tried another black response to white's E2 move:
  E3 B2 E1 C4 D4 D5(disallow eye) B1(*) B3(protect) A4(fight)
 which will likely result in black win on territory, but not pass-alive.
</p>

<p class="floatcleared"></p>
<div id="E2myplaybot" class="floatright"></div>

<p>
Interestingly, when I played this sequence against my AZ bot, it chose a different route: after black B1,
bot played white A2, which seems to result in a white win again!
  E3 B2 E1 C4 D4 D5(disallow eye) B1 A2(*)

<p class="floatcleared"></p>

<h3> Bot's actual (and better) response to E2</h3>
<div id="E2bot" class="floatright"></div>
<a>
I scratched my head for quite some time. Then it dawns on me that bot must have explored this already. Lo and behold,
here is what the bot has determined:

Looks like when white plays E2(extend), C4(threat) B3(extend) B2 D4 B4(threat) A3(extend) A2(threat) E3(take)
which leads to the <a href="https://hyu2000.github.io/go5/model-evolution.html">alien shape</a> and a black win.

  <p class="floatcleared"></p>

<p>
There are other interesting scenarios. The nice thing about 5x5 board is that you don't waste too much time :)
These mind-boggling puzzles are probably better left for bots to solve.

<!--
<h2>others </h2>
Another scenario that I noted a while back. This is not on the best path. Bot spent quite some time on C2 C3 D3 C4
opening, thinking that white would win by 1 point. Turns out this is the right response:
  C2 C3 D3 C4 E2(!) B2 B1 B3 D4
white has to be careful for its own survival now. So this is at least B+3. [model-evolution]
